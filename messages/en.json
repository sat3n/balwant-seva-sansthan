      "p1": "Balwant Seva Sansthan was established in the village Khairi, Hisar on 31st of December 2025 in loving memory of late Shri Balwant Singh, a man who spent his life serving the people of his village Khairi and left the world too soon. Him and his wife, Late Smt. Sunehari Devi believed that true wealth lies not in what we accumulate but in what we give back to our community. They both were known to be always open to those in need, and never turned away anyone seeking help, whether it was a meal, guidance, or simply a kind word.",
      "p2": "Inspired by their selfless spirit, their son Saty Narain Kundu founded this sansthan to carry forward their vision of a just and empowered rural society. A Civil Engineer by education who retired from the Haryana Government HSAMB Department as Sub Divisional Engineer, he has always believed in giving back and supporting the community. He maintains that one must never stray from their roots and should stay humble while keeping strong engagement with society.",
      "p3": "Today, Balwant Seva Sansthan runs free medical camps, supports children's education, manages the Sunehari Devi Library for girls, and conducts awareness drives about government welfare schemes and modern agricultural practices. Every program we run is a tribute to the belief that even one person's dedication can transform an entire community."
